This code implements hierarchical LDA with a fixed depth tree and a
stick breaking prior on the depth weights.  An infinite-depth tree can
be approximated by setting the depth to be very high.  This code
requires that you have installed the GSL package.

The input format of the data is the same as in the LDA-C package.
Each line contains

 [# of unique terms] [term #] : [count] ...

The settings file controls various parameters of the model.  There are
several settings files contained in this directory.


IMPORTANT:

I hope that this code is useful to you, but please note that this code
is UNSUPPORTED.  Do not email me with questions.  I like posting as
much code as possible, but I unfortunately do not have the time to
support all of it.  (This paragraph is my solution to the problem.)
